Scope: This is a guessing game program. The computer will generate a random number and then the user will try to guess it for the first example. In the second example I have implemented the use of linear search to guess the number. Lastly, using binary search to guess the number

What I've learned: Implementation of linear and binary search to guess the number quicker.
